# Applicative Demo (Haskell)

This is a simple Haskell demo project that introduces **Applicative Functors**.

It demonstrates:

- Functor mapping with `fmap`
- The limits of `Functor`
- Function application with `<*>`
- Lifting values with `pure`
- Applicative laws (identity, homomorphism)
- Programming with effects using `Maybe` (failure) and lists (non-determinism)
- A manual implementation of `liftA2`
